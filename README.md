# **Minimal++ compiler**
<br />Minimal++ is a simple programming language inspired by 'BASIC', created for academic purposes.
<br />This program compiles Minimal++ programs into MIPS32 Architecture assembly files. Through the process it also
<br />generates an intermediate code files, a intermediate executable file of the compiled programm in C language
<br />and symbol table files.
