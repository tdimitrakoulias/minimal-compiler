# **Minimal++ compiler**
<br />Minimal++ is a simple programming language inspired by 'BASIC', created for academic purposes.
<br />This program compiles Minimal++ programs into MIPS32 Architecture assembly files. Through the process it also
<br />generates an intermediate code files, a intermediate executable file of the compiled programm in C language
<br />and symbol table files. Developed in python (v3.7.4 ).

### Open 'Minimal++ Grammar Rules.pdf' to review the grammar rules of Minimal++.

## File types
- `.min:` Minimal++ program
- `.int:` Intermediate code file
- `.c:`   Compiled Executable in C
- `.sym:` Symbol table file
- `.asm:` Compiled MIPS Assembly file.
## Execution
`./minimal_compiler.py [input_file.py]`
